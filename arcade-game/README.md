### Objectives

To win the game you will have to reach 1000 or more points.

You will win points by collecting Gems and reaching the water.

* Blue Gem = 10 points
* Green Gem = 20 points
* Orange Gem = 30 points
* Star = 50 points
* Reach the water = 100 points

### Lives

You will start the game with 3 lives, you can win lives by collecting hearts.

If your lives get to zero before you reach 1000 points you lose the game.

Avoid the bugs in order not to die.

### Safe areas

The green areas are safe areas. You can move freely on those areas without dying.

### The bugs

The game has bugs that will kill you. They come at random speeds and locations. Beware.

## TODO

Once I complete the course I would like to add difficulty levels and a selection of the player at least, perhaps even different themes.
I would like to add a leaderboard or score recording.


## TL;DR
