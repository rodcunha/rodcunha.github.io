# How to contribute

Even though this was done as part of a Udacity nanodegree project, I intend to add to this game as I've made it with the intention of developing a game for my children.

I've started with the Paw Patrol deck but will add other themes. I will also want to add a difficulty selection where the user can choose from Easy, Medium or Hard.
This will change the number of panels on the board to 8, 16, 32.

You are welcome to add suggestions or contribute to these features.
I will also accept children themed decks of 8 or 16 square images of no larger than 350px/350px.
